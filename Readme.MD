# Event hub domain model
This Java library contains the model classes for EventHub domain. These model classes were originally part of the 
event-hub-service project and have been extracted into a separate library to enable reuse across both the 
[event-hub-site](https://github.com/raghuporumamila/event-hub-site) and [event-hub-service](https://github.com/raghuporumamila/event-hub-db-service-v2) microservices.
